- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @djain87

With 3+ years of hands-on 
experience as an ERP Consultant, I 
am eager to transition into a Data 
Analyst role where I can utilize my 
extensive knowledge and analytical 
skills. 
I have recently completed an
intensive Data Analyst boot camp 
which helped me to refine my SQL 
Knowledge, Power BI and Data 
Visualization. Additionally, the boot 
camp provided me with valuable 
exposure to Python, Shell Scripting,
GitHub, and working within an 
Agile framework, expanding my 
technical skill set and adaptability
